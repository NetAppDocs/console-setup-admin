The NetApp Console supports the Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) with the Console agent and with Cloud Volumes ONTAP (including the mediator for HA deployments). In most cases, IMDSv2 is automatically configured on new EC2 instances. IMDSv1 was enabled prior to March 2024. If required by your security policies, you might need to manually configure IMDSv2 on your EC2 instances.

.Before you begin

* The Console agent version must be 3.9.38 or later.

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP must be running one of the following versions:
** 9.12.1 P2 (or any subsequent patch)
** 9.13.0 P4 (or any subsequent patch)
** 9.13.1 or any version after this release

* This change requires you to restart the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances.

* These steps require the use of the AWS CLI because you must change the response hop limit to 3.

.About this task

IMDSv2 provides enhanced protection against vulnerabilities. https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/defense-in-depth-open-firewalls-reverse-proxies-ssrf-vulnerabilities-ec2-instance-metadata-service/[Learn more about IMDSv2 from the AWS Security Blog^]

The Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) is enabled as follows on EC2 instances:

* For new Console agent deployments from the Console or using https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/automate/overview.html[Terraform scripts^], IMDSv2 is enabled by default on the EC2 instance.

* If you launch a new EC2 instance in AWS and then manually install the Console agent software, IMDSv2 is also enabled by default.

* If you launch the Console agent from the AWS Marketplace, IMDSv1 is enabled by default. You can manually configure IMDSv2 on the EC2 instance.

* For existing Console agents, IMDSv1 is still supported but you can manually configure IMDSv2 on the EC2 instance if you prefer.

* For Cloud Volumes ONTAP, IMDSv1 is enabled by default on new and existing instances. You can manually configure IMDSv2 on the EC2 instances if you prefer.

.Steps

. Require the use of IMDSv2 on the Console agent instance: 

.. Connect to the Linux VM for the Console agent.
+
When you created the Console agent instance in AWS, you provided an AWS access key and secret key. You can use this key pair to SSH to the instance. The user name for the EC2 Linux instance is ubuntu (for Console agents created prior to May 2023, the user name was ec2-user).
+
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html[AWS Docs: Connect to your Linux instance^]

.. Install the AWS CLI.
+
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html[AWS Docs: Install or update to the latest version of the AWS CLI^]

.. Use the `aws ec2 modify-instance-metadata-options` command to require the use of IMDSv2 and to change the PUT response hop limit to 3.
+
*Example*
+
[source,awscli]
aws ec2 modify-instance-metadata-options \
    --instance-id <instance-id> \
    --http-put-response-hop-limit 3 \
    --http-tokens required \
    --http-endpoint enabled

+
NOTE: The `http-tokens` parameter sets IMDSv2 to required. When `http-tokens` is required, you must also set `http-endpoint` to enabled.

. Require the use of IMDSv2 on Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances:

.. Go to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2 console^]

.. From the navigation pane, select *Instances*.

.. Select a Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance.

.. Select *Actions > Instance settings > Modify instance metadata options*.

.. On the *Modify instance metadata options* dialog box, select the following:
+
* For *Instance metadata service*, select *Enable*.
* For *IMDSv2*, select *Required*.
* Select *Save*.

.. Repeat these steps for other Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances, including the HA mediator.

.. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-managing-state.html[Stop and start the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances^]

.Result

The Console agent instance and Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances are now configured to use IMDSv2.
