The NetApp Console offers multiple _deployment modes_ that enable you to meet your business and security requirements. 

* _Standard mode_ leverages a software as a service (SaaS) layer to provide full functionality. Users access the Console through a web-based hosted interface
*  _Restricted mode_ is available for organizations that have connectivity restrictions who want to install the NetApp Console in their own public cloud. Users access the Console through a web-based interface that's hosted on a Console agent in their cloud environment.

+
NetApp Console restricts traffic, communication, and data in restricted mode, and you must ensure your environment (on-premises and in the cloud) complies with required regulations.

== Overview

Each deployment mode differs in outbound connectivity, location, installation, authentication, data services, and charging methods.

Standard mode::
You use a SaaS service from the web-based console. Depending on the data services and features that you plan to use, a Console organization admin creates one or more Console agents to manage data within your hybrid cloud environment. 
+
This mode uses encrypted data transmission over the public internet.

Restricted mode::
You install a Console agent in the cloud (in a government, sovereign, or commercial region), and it has limited outbound connectivity to the NetApp Console SaaS layer.
+
This mode is typically used by state and local governments and regulated companies.
+
<<Restricted mode, Learn more about outbound connectivity to the SaaS layer>>.

BlueXP private mode (legacy BlueXP interface only)::

BlueXP private mode (legacy BlueXP interface) is typically used with on-premises environments that have no internet connection and with secure cloud regions, which includes AWS Secret Cloud, AWS Top Secret Cloud, and Azure IL6. NetApp continues to support these environments with the legacy BlueXP interface. link:media/BlueXP-Private-Mode-legacy-interface.pdf[PDF documentation for BlueXP private mode^]

Read through the following sections to learn more about these modes, including which NetApp Console features and services are supported.

== Standard mode

The following image is an example of a standard mode deployment.

image:diagram-standard-mode.png["A conceptual image that shows the public internet where the web-based console, SaaS layer, and auth0 authentication are available, a virtual network in the cloud where a Console agent is running and managing Cloud Volumes ONTAP and an AFF cluster in an on-premises data center."]

The Console works as follows in standard mode:

Outbound communication::
Connectivity is required from a Console agent to the Console SaaS layer, to your cloud provider's publicly available resources, and to other essential components for day-to-day operations.
+

* link:task-install-agent-azure-console.html#networking-azure-agent[Endpoints that an agent contacts in Azure]
* link:task-install-agent-google-console-gcloud.html#networking-gcp-agent[Endpoints that an agent contacts in Google Cloud]

Supported location for an agent::
In standard mode, an agent is supported in the cloud or on your premises.

Console agent installation::
You can install an agent using one of the following methods:
* From the Console
* From the AWS or Azure Marketplace 
* From the Google Cloud SDK
* Manually using an installer on a Linux host in your data center or cloud
* Use the provided OVA in your VCenter environment.

Console agent upgrades::
NetApp automatically upgrades your agent monthly.p.

User interface access::
The user interface is accessible from the web-based console that's provided through the SaaS layer.

API endpoint::
API calls are made to the following endpoint:
\https://api.bluexp.netapp.com

Authentication::
Authentication with auth0 or NetApp Support Site (NSS) logins. Identity federation is available.

Supported data services::
All NetApp data services are supported. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/data-services-family/index.html[Learn more about NetApp data services^].

Supported licensing options::
Marketplace subscriptions and BYOL are supported with standard mode; however, the supported licensing options depends on which NetApp data service you are using. Review the documentation for each service to learn more about the available licensing options.

How to get started with standard mode::
Go to the https://console.netapp.com[NetApp Console^] and sign up.

== Restricted mode

The following image is an example of a restricted mode deployment.

image:diagram-restricted-mode.png["A conceptual image that shows the public internet where the SaaS layer and auth0 authentication are available, a virtual network in the cloud where a Console agent is running and providing access to the web-based console, and is managing Cloud Volumes ONTAP and an AFF cluster in an on-premises data center."]

The Console works as follows in restricted mode:

Outbound communication::
An agent requires outbound connectivity to the Console SaaS layer for data services, software upgrades, authentication, and metadata transmission.
+
The Console SaaS layer does not initiate communication to an agent. Agents initiate all communication with the Console SaaS layer, pulling or pushing data as needed.
+
A connection is also required to cloud provider resources from within the region.

Supported location for an agent::
In restricted mode, an agent is supported in the cloud: in a government region, sovereign region, or commercial region.

Console agent installation::
You can install from the AWS or Azure Marketplace or a manual installation on your own Linux host or us a downloadable OVA in your VCenter environment.

Console agent upgrades::
NetApp automatically upgrades your agent software with monthly updates.

User interface access::
The user interface is accessible from an agent virtual machine that's deployed in your cloud region.

API endpoint::
API calls are made to the agent virtual machine.

Authentication::
Authentication is provided through auth0. Identity federation is also available.

Supported storage management and data services::
The following storage and data services with restricted mode:
