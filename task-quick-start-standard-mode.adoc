Get started with the NetApp Console in standard mode by preparing networking for the Console, signing up and creating an account, and optionally creating a Console agent.

In standard mode, you access a web-based console that is hosted as a Software-as-a-service (SaaS) product from NetApp. Before starting, ensure you understand link:concept-modes.html[deployment modes] and link:concept-agents.html[Console agents].

Computers that access the NetApp console should have connections to specific endpoints. If your network restricts outbound access, you should ensure that these endpoints are allowed.

Advanced storage management features and some NetApp data services require that you install a Console agent. The Console agent enables the Console to manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment.
