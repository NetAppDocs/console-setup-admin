When the NetApp Console launches a Console agent in Azure, it attaches a custom role to the VM that provides the agent with permissions to manage resources and processes within that Azure subscription. The agent uses the permissions to make API calls to several Azure services.

Whether or not you need to create this custom role for the agent depends on how you deployed it.



.Deploying from NetApp Console

When you use the Console to deploy the agent virtual machine in Azure, it enables a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[system-assigned managed identity^] on the virtual machine, creates a custom role, and assigns it to the virtual machine. The role provides the Console with the permissions required to manage resources and processes within that Azure subscription. The role's permissions are kept up-to-date when the agent is upgraded. You don't need to create this role for the agent or manage updates.

.Deploying manually or from Azure marketplace

When you deploy the agent from the Azure Marketplace or if you manually install the agent on a Linux host, then you need to set up the custom role yourself and maintain its permissions with any changes.

You'll need to ensure that the role is up to date as new permissions are added in subsequent releases. If new permissions are required, they will be listed in the release notes.

== How Azure permissions are used

The following sections describe how the permissions are used for each NetApp storage system and data service. This information can be helpful if your corporate policies dictate that permissions are only provided as needed.

=== Azure NetApp Files

The agent makes the following API requests when you use NetApp Data Classification to scan Azure NetApp Files data:

* Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/read
* Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/read
* Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/volumes/write
* Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/volumes/read
* Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/volumes/delete

=== NetApp Backup and Recovery

The Console agent makes the following API requests for NetApp Backup and Recovery:

//tag::backup-permissions[]

* Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/accessPolicies/write
* Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/read
* Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/locations/read
* Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/read

* Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/read
* Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/virtualNetworkLinks/read
* Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/delete
* Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete
* Microsoft.Resources/deployments/delete
* Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/assign/action
//end::backup-permissions[]

The agent makes the following API requests when you use the Search & Restore functionality:

//tag::backup-search-restore-permissions[]
* Microsoft.Synapse/workspaces/write
* Microsoft.Synapse/workspaces/read
* Microsoft.Synapse/workspaces/delete
* Microsoft.Synapse/register/action
* Microsoft.Synapse/checkNameAvailability/action

* Microsoft.Synapse/workspaces/firewallRules/read
* Microsoft.Synapse/workspaces/replaceAllIpFirewallRules/action
* Microsoft.Synapse/workspaces/operationResults/read
* Microsoft.Synapse/workspaces/privateEndpointConnectionsApproval/action
//end::backup-search-restore-permissions[]

=== NetApp Data Classification

The agent makes the following API requests when you use Data Classification.

=== Tiering

The agent makes the following API requests when you set up NetApp Cloud Tiering.

//tag::tiering-permissions-setup[]
* Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action
* Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read
* Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/locations/read
//end::tiering-permissions-setup[]

The Console agent makes the following API requests for daily operations.

//tag::tiering-permissions-operations[]
* Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/read
* Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/managementPolicies/read
* Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/managementPolicies/write
* Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read
//end::tiering-permissions-operations[]

== Change log

As permissions are added and removed, we'll note them in the sections below.

=== 9 September 2024

* Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/listClusterUserCredential/action
* Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/read

=== 22 August 2024

The following permissions were added to the JSON policy because they are required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP support of Virtual Machine Scale Sets:

* Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/delete

=== 5 December 2023

The following permissions are no longer needed for NetApp Backup and Recovery when backing up volume data to Azure Blob storage:
