.Required roles
The Federation admin role is required to make create and manage federations. Federation viewer can view the Federation page.  link:reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn more about access roles.]

NOTE: You can federate with your corporate IdP or with the NetApp Support Site. NetApp recommends choosing one or the other, but not both.

NetApp supports service provider-initiated (SP-initiated) SSO only. You need to first configure the identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider. Then, you can create a connection in the Console that uses the identity provider's configuration.

You can set up a federated connection with PingFederate to enable single sign-on (SSO) for the Console . The process involves configuring your PingFederate server to trust the Console as a service provider and then creating the connection in the Console .

* For the *Logout URL*, use `https://netapp-cloud-account.auth0.com/logout`
* For *Audience/Entity ID*, use `urn:auth0:netapp-cloud-account:<fed-domain-name-saml>` where <fed-domain-name-pingfederate> is the domain name for the federation. For example, if your domain is `example.com`, the Audience/Entity ID would be `urn:auth0:netappcloud-account:fed-example-com-pingfederate`.

.. Copy the PingFederate server URL. You will need this URL when creating the connection in the Console.

.. Download the X.509 certificate from your PingFederate server. It needs to be in Base64-encoded PEM format (.pem, .crt, .cer).
