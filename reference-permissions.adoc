To use NetApp Console features and services, you'll need to provide permissions so that the Console can perform operations in your cloud environment. Use the links on this page to quickly access the permissions that you need based on your goal.

== AWS permissions

The NetApp Console requires AWS permissions for a Console agent and for individual services.

=== Console agents

[cols=3*,options="header",cols="20,60,20"]

| Goal
| Description
| Link

| Deploy a Console agent from the Console
| The user who creates a Console agent from the Console needs specific permissions to deploy the instance in AWS.
| link:task-install-connector-aws-bluexp.html#aws-permissions-agent[Set up AWS permissions]

| Provide permissions for a Console agent
| When the Console deploys a Console agent, it attaches a policy to the instance that provides the permissions required to manage resources and processes in your AWS account.

You need to set up the policy yourself if you deploy a Console agent from the AWS Marketplace, if you manually install a Console agent, or if you link:task-adding-aws-accounts.html#add-credentials-agent-aws[add more AWS credentials to a Console agent].

You also need to ensure that the policy is up to date as new permissions are added in subsequent releases.
