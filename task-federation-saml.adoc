[.lead]
Federate with your SAML 2.0 IdP provider to enable single sign-on (SSO) for the NEtApp Console. This allows users to log in using their corporate credentials.

.Required role
The Federation admin role is required to make create and manage federations. Federation viewer can view the Federation page.  link:reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn more about access roles.]

NOTE: You can federate with your corporate IdP or with the NetApp Support Site. You can't federate with both.

NetApp supports service provider-initiated (SP-initiated) SSO only. You need to first configure the identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider. Then, you can create a connection in the Console that uses the identity provider's configuration.

You can set up a federated connection with your SAML 2.0 provider to enable single sign-on (SSO) for the Console. The process involves configuring your provider to trust NetApp as a service provider and then creating the connection in the Console.

. For your connection method, choose *Protocol* and then select *SAML Identity Provider*.

. Select *Next*.

. Configure your SAML identity provider to trust NetApp as a service provider. You need to do this step on your SAML provider server.  

.. Ensure that your IdP has the attribute `email` set to the user's email address. This is required for the Console to identify users correctly:
[source, xml]
<saml:AttributeStatement xmlns:x500="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:profiles:attribute:X500" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <saml:Attribute Name="email" NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:X509SubjectName">
        <saml:AttributeValue xsi:type="xs:string">email@domain.com</saml:AttributeValue>
    </saml:Attribute>
</saml:AttributeStatement>



.. Use the following values when registering your SAML application with the Console:

+

* For the *Reply URL* or *Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL*, use `https://netapp-cloud-account.auth0.com/login/callback`
 
* For the *Logout URL*, use `https://netapp-cloud-account.auth0.com/logout`
* For *Audience/Entity ID*, use `urn:auth0:netapp-cloud-account:<fed-domain-name-saml>` where <fed-domain-name-saml> is the domain name you want to use for federation. For example, if your domain is `example.com`, the Audience/Entity ID would be `urn:auth0:netapp-cloud-account:fed-example-com-samlp`.

.. After creating the trust, copy the following values from your SAML provider server:
+   
* Sign In URL
* Sign Out URL (optional)

.. Download the X.509 certificate from your SAML provider server. It needs to be in PEM, CER, or CRT format.


. Return to the Console, and select *Next* to create the connection.

. Create the connection with SAML.  
.. Enter the *Sign In URL* of your SAML server.

.. Upload the X.509 certificate that you downloaded from your SAML provider server. 

.. Optionally, enter the *Sign Out URL* of your SAML server.

. Select *Create connection*. The system creates the connection in a few seconds.
