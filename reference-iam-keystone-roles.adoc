Keystone roles provide access to the Keystone dashboards and allow users to view and manage their Keystone subscription. There are two Keystone roles: Keystone admin and Keystone viewer. The main difference between the two roles is the actions they can take in Keystone. The Keystone admin role is the only role that is allowed to create service requests or modify subscriptions.

.Example for Keystone roles in NetApp Console

XYZ Corporation has four storage engineers from different departments who view Keystone subscription information. Although all of these users need to monitor the Keystone subscription, only the team lead is allowed to make service requests. Three of the team members are given the *Keystone viewer* role, while the team lead is given the *Keystone admin* role so that there is a point of control over service requests for the company.



The following table indicates the actions that each Keystone role can perform.
