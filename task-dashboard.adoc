Monitoring the health of your storage estate ensures that you are aware of issues with storage protection and can take steps to resolve them. Using the NetApp Console Home page, view a status of your backups and restores from NetApp Backup and Recovery and the number of workloads that are at risk for a ransomware attack or protected as indicated by NetApp Ransomware Resilience. You can review the storage capacity for individual clusters and Cloud Volumes ONTAP, ONTAP alerts, storage performance capacity per cluster or Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, the different types of licenses you have, and more.

All panes on the Home page show data at the organization level. The Storage capacity and Storage performance panes show systems associated with projects that the user can access based on IAM permissions.

The system refreshes the data on the Home page every five minutes. Caching may cause the data on this page to differ from real values for up to 15 minutes.

NOTE: Accurate metrics on the Home page require appropriately sized and configured Console agents.

== Required NetApp Console roles

Each pane in the Home page requires different user roles: 

* *Storage capacity pane*: Ability to see the NetApp Console Systems page
* *ONTAP alerts pane*: Folder or project admin, Operations Support Analyst, Organization admin, Organization viewer, Super admin, Super viewer
* *Storage performance capacity pane*: Ability to see the NetApp Console Systems page
* *Licenses and subscriptions pane*: Folder or project admin, Organization admin, Organization viewer, Super admin, Super viewer

== Enable metrics to appear on the Home page    

You can see metrics on the Home page when the following conditions are met: 

* You are logged into a SaaS instance of the NetApp Console. 
* You belong to an organization with existing storage resources (agent and cluster or Cloud Volumes ONTAP system).
* At least one Console agent is enabled.
* At least one cluster or Cloud Volumes ONTAP system has been added on that agent.


To enable metrics to appear on the Home page, complete the following tasks: 

* Enable at least one Console agent. 
* Add at least one cluster or one Cloud Volumes ONTAP using that agent.  

== View the overall storage capacity

The Storage capacity pane provides the following information across ONTAP clusters and Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems: 

* Number of ONTAP systems discovered in the Console
* Number of Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems discovered in the Console
* Capacity usage per cluster 

The order of the clusters or Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems is based on the amount of capacity used. The cluster or system with the highest capacity appears first for easy identification.

Warning indicators show for clusters at 80% capacity, with data updating every five minutes.



TIP: If you have multiple projects, you might see different data in the Storage capacity pane compared to the Systems page. This is because the Systems page shows information based on the project level, whereas the Storage capacity pane shows information at the organization level. Also, the data on this pane might differ from real values for a maximum of 15 minutes because the data is cached for that duration to optimize performance.

.Steps

. From the NetApp Console menu, review the Storage capacity pane. 
. In the Storage capacity pane, select *View* to go to the Console Systems page. 
. On the Systems page, select the project containing the cluster you want to view. 
. On the Systems page, select a cluster to view more details about that cluster.



== View ONTAP alerts

View issues or potential risks in your NetApp on-premises ONTAP environments. You can see some non-EMS alerts and some EMS alerts. 

The data updates every 5 minutes. 


You can see ONTAP alerts with these severities:

* Critical
* Warning
* Informational

You can see ONTAP alerts for these impact areas:

* Capacity
* Performance
* Protection
* Availability
* Security


TIP: Caching optimizes performance, but may cause the data on this pane to differ from actual values for up to 15 minutes.

*Systems supported*

* An on-premises ONTAP NAS or SAN system is supported.
* Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems are not supported.

*Data sources supported*

View alerts regarding certain events that occur in ONTAP. They are a combination of EMS and metric-based alerts.

For details about ONTAP alerts, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-alerts/index.html[About ONTAP alerts^].

For a list of alerts that you might see, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-alerts/alerts-use-dashboard.html[View potential risks in ONTAP storage^].


.Steps

. From the NetApp Console menu, review the ONTAP alerts pane. 
. Optionally, filter the alerts by selecting the severity level or change the filter to show alerts based on impact area.  

. In the ONTAP alerts pane, select *View* to go to the Console Alerts page. 


== View storage performance capacity 

Review the storage performance capacity used per cluster or Cloud Volumes ONTAP system to determine how performance capacity, latency, and IOPS are impacting your workloads. For example, you might find that you need to shift workloads to minimize latency and maximize IOPS and throughput for your critical workloads.

The system arranges clusters and systems by performance capacity, listing the highest capacity first for easy identification.

TIP: Caching optimizes performance, but may cause the data on this pane to differ from actual values for up to 15 minutes.

.Steps

. From the NetApp Console menu, review the Storage performance pane. 


. In the Storage performance pane, select *View* to go to a Performance page that lists all the clusters and Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems data for performance capacity, IOPS, and latency. 
. Select a cluster to view its details in System Manager.
