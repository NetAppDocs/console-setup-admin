When you sign up for the NetApp Console, you're prompted to create a new organization. The organization includes one member (an Organization admin) and one default project. To set up identity and access management (IAM) to meet your business needs, you'll need to customize your organization's hierarchy, add additional members, add or discover resources, and associate those resources across your hierarchy.

You must have *Organization admin* permissions to administer identity and access for your entire organization. If you have *Folder or project admin* permissions, you can only administer the folders and projects for which you have permissions.

Follow these steps to set up a new organization. The order may vary based on your organization's needs.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Associate resources with additional projects

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Adding or discovering a system in the Console automatically associates the resource with the currently selected project. To make that resource available to another project in your organization, associate it with the respective project. If a Console agent is used to manage the resource, associate the Console agent with the respective project.
