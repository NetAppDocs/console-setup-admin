[[check-agent-status]]
== Check the Console agent status

Use one of the following commands to verify your Console agent. All services should have a status of _Running_. If this isn't the case, contact NetApp support.

[NOTE]
====

For more detailed information about accessing the Console agent diagnostics, see the following topics:

* link:task-maintain-connectors.html#connect-linux-host[Check the Console agent status (for Linux host deployments)]
* link:task-agent-vm-config.html#connect-vcenter-host[Check the Console agent status (for VCenter deployments)]
====

Docker (for Ubuntu and VCenter deployments):: 
+
[source,cli]
docker ps -a

Podman:: 
+
[source,cli]
podman ps -a


== Verify network access
Ensure that the Console agent has the network access it needs. link:reference-networking-saas-console.html[Learn more about required network access points.]


[[troubleshoot-installation]]
== Console agent installation issues

If the installation fails, you can view a report and logs to help you fix the issues.


include::_include/validate-agent-host.adoc[]

include::_include/endpoints-config-check-note.adoc[]


=== Failed installation on the endpoints used for upgrades
If the verification report includes ONLY a failure to contact the following endpoints:

* \https://bluexpinfraprod.eastus2.data.azurecr.io
* \https://bluexpinfraprod.azurecr.io 

You can run the installer again and uncheck the *Validate agent configuration* check box on the *Review* page. The Console agent will install without validating the endpoints.

* For new agent deployments, NetApp checks for the following endpoint supported with 4.0.0 and higher, link:reference-networking-saas-console.html[listed here]. This configuration check fails with an error if you are using the previous endpoints used for upgrades,  link:reference-networking-saas-console-prev.html[listed here]. NetApp recommends updating your firewall rules to allow access to the current endpoints and block access to the previous endpoints. link:task-troubleshoot-connector.html#update-endpoint-list[Learn how to update the endpoint list.]

== Work with NetApp Support
If you haven't been able to resolve the issues with your Console agent, you may want to contact NetApp Support. NetApp support may ask for the Console agent ID or for you to send the Console agent logs to them if they don't have them already.

include::_include/endpoints-config-check-note.adoc[]

=== Find the Console agent ID 

To help you get started, you may need the system ID of your Console agent. The ID is typically used for licensing and troubleshooting purposes.

.Steps


. Select *Administration > Support > Agents*.
+
You can find the system ID at the top of the page.
+
*Example*
+
image:screenshot-system-id.png[A screenshot that shows the System ID that appears in the Support Dashboard.]

. Hover and click on the ID to copy it.

=== View the Console agent version

You can view the version of your Console agent to verify that the agent automatically upgraded to the latest release or because you need to share it with your NetApp representative.

.Steps


. Select *Administration > Support > Agents*.
+
The version displays at the top of the page.

=== Download or send an AutoSupport message

If you're having problems, NetApp might ask you to send an AutoSupport message to NetApp support for troubleshooting purposes.

NOTE: The NetApp Console takes up to five hours to send AutoSupport messages due to load balancing. For urgent communication, download the file and send it manually.

.Steps

. Select *Administration > Support > Agents*.

. Depending on how you need to send the information to NetApp support, choose one of the following options:

.. Select the option to download the AutoSupport message to your local machine. You can then send it to NetApp Support using a preferred method.

.. Select *Send AutoSupport* to directly send the message to NetApp Support.



== Fix download failures when using a Google Cloud NAT gateway

The Console agent automatically downloads software updates for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Your configuration can cause the download to fail if it uses a Google Cloud NAT gateway. You can correct this issue by limiting the number of parts that the software image is divided into. This step must be completed by using the API.

.Step

.	Submit a PUT request to /occm/config with the following JSON as body:
+
[source.json]
{
  "maxDownloadSessions": 32
}
+
The value for _maxDownloadSessions_ can be 1 or any integer greater than 1. If the value is 1, then the downloaded image will not be divided.
+
Note that 32 is an example value. The value depends on your NAT configuration and the number of simultaneous sessions.
