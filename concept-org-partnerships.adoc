Partnerships allow secure management of NetApp resources across organizations using role-driven relationships in the Console. The initiating organization grants access to its resources, while the accepting organization provides the users or service accounts to be granted access. Partnerships are established through a self-service workflow, giving the initiating organization full control over which resources are shared, what roles are assigned, and the ability to onboard, manage, or revoke partner access as needed.

Customers can authorize MSPs or resellers to manage NetApp environments without requiring complicated setups. Customers can control which clusters partners can access and what roles they have, and can revoke access at any time to maintain security and compliance.

As a partner, you gain centralized visibility and control across customer environments. You can easily switch to a customer's organization to manage resources, run data services, and monitor health within defined boundaries, reducing custom tooling and ensuring alignment with each customerâ€™s policies.
