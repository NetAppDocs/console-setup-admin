You can grant access to partnership users by assigning them specific roles for folders and projects within your organization.

A partner organization must first add members to the partnership before you can assign them roles for resources in your organization. link:task-partnerships-assign-users.html[Learn how to add members to a partnership.]

== Understand roles for partnership users

You can manage roles for members of partner organizations in the same way that you do for your own. However, not all roles are available to partnership users. In particular, you can't grant partner users a role that allows software updates. Updating ONTAP software generally requires direct network access.

You can assign following roles to partner users:

== Add a role to a partner user
You provide access to your organization's resources by adding a role to a member. When you assign a role, you specify one resource and one role. You can assign more than one role to a user.

For example, if you had two projects and wanted the same user to have the role of Backup and recovery admin for both, you would need to provide the role to the user for each project. Similarly if you wanted to provide a user with two different roles for the same project, you would need to assign each role separately.
