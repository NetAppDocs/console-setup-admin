Ransomware Resilience roles provide users access to NetApp Ransomware Resilience. Ransomware Resilience supports the following roles:

* Ransomware Resilience admin
* Ransomware Resilience viewer
* Ransomware Resilience user behavior admin
* Ransomware Resilience user behavior viewer

The roles confer different levels of access to settings and actions.

The actions available to the Ransomware Resilience user behavior admin and user behavior viewer roles are limited to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/data-services-ransomware-resilience/suspicious-user-activity.html[suspicious user behavior^].
