Depending on the actions that you've taken in the Console, you might have associated ONTAP credentials and NetApp Support Site (NSS) credentials with your user login. You can view and manage those credentials after you've associated them. For example, if you change the password for these credentials, then you'll need to update the password in the Console.

== ONTAP credentials 

Users need ONTAP admin credentials to discover ONTAP clusters in the Console. However, ONTAP System Manager access depends on whether or not you are using a Console agent.

.Without a Console agent
Users are prompted to enter their ONTAP credentials to access ONTAP System Manager for the cluster. Users can choose to save these credentials in the Console which means they wonâ€™t be prompted to enter them each time. User credentials are only visible to the respective user and can be managed from the User credentials page.

.With a Console agent
By default, users are not prompted to enter their ONTAP credentials to access ONTAP System Manager. However, a Console administrator (with the Organization admin role) can configure the Console to prompt users to enter their ONTAP credentials. When this setting is enabled, users need enter their ONTAP credentials each time.

== NSS credentials

The NSS credentials associated with your NetApp Console login enable support registration, case management, and access to Digital Advisor.

* When you access *Support > Resources* and register for support, you're prompted to associate NSS credentials with your login.
+
This registers your organization or account for support and activates support entitlement. Only one user in your organization must associate a NetApp Support Site account with their login to register for support and activate support entitlement. After this is completed, the *Resources* page shows that your account is registered for support.

* When you access *Administration > Support > Case Management*, you're prompted to enter your NSS credentials, if you haven't already done so. This page enables you to create and manage the support cases associated with your NSS account and with your company.

* When you access Digital Advisor in the Console, you're prompted to log in to Digital Advisor by entering your NSS credentials.

Note the following about the NSS account associated with your login:

* The account is managed at the user level, which means it isn't viewable by other users who log in.

* There can be only one NSS account associated with Digital Advisor and support case management, per user.

* If you're trying to associate a NetApp Support Site account with a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, you can only choose from the NSS accounts that were added to the organization that you are a member of.
+
NSS account-level credentials are different than the NSS account that's associated with your login. NSS account-level credentials enable you to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP with BYOL, register PAYGO systems, and upgrade its software.
