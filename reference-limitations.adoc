Known limitations identify platforms, devices, or functions that are not supported by this release of the product, or that do not interoperate correctly with it. Review these limitations carefully.

These limitations are specific to the set up for the NEtApp Console and administration: the agent, the software as a service (SaaS) platform, and more.

== Console agent limitations


=== Possible conflict with IP addresses in the 172 range

The NetApp Console deploys an agent with two interfaces that have IP addresses in the 172.17.0.0/16 and 172.18.0.0/16 ranges.

If your network has a subnet configured with either of these ranges, then you might experience connectivity failures from the Console. For example, discovering on-premises ONTAP clusters in the Console might fail.

See Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Cloud_Services/Cloud_Manager/Cloud_Manager_shows_inactive_as_Connector_IP_range_in_172.x.x.x_conflict_with_docker_network[Agent IP conflict with existing network] for instructions on how to change the IP address of the agentâ€™s interfaces.

=== SSL decryption isn't supported

The Console doesn't support firewall configurations that have SSL decryption enabled. If SSL decryption is enabled, error messages appear in the Console and the agent instance displays as inactive.

For enhanced security, you have the option to link:task-installing-https-cert.html[install an HTTPS certificate signed by a certificate authority (CA)].

=== Blank page when loading the local UI

If you load the web-based console that's running on an agent, the interface might fail to display sometimes, and you just get a blank page.

This issue is related to a caching problem. The workaround is to use an incognito or private web browser session.

=== Shared Linux hosts are not supported

The agent isn't supported on a VM that is shared with other applications. The VM must be dedicated to the agent software.

=== 3rd-party agents and extensions

3rd-party agents or VM extensions are not supported on the agent VM.
