You can manage the Google Cloud credentials that are associated with a Console agent VM instance by associating a marketplace subscription and by troubleshooting the subscription process. Both of these tasks ensure that you can use your marketplace subscription to pay for data services.

== Associate a Marketplace subscription with Google Cloud credentials

When you deploy a Console agent in Google Cloud, the Console creates a default set of credentials that are associated with a Console agent VM instance. At any time, you can change the Google Cloud Marketplace subscription that is associated with these credentials. The subscription enables you to create a pay-as-you-go Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, and to use other data services.

Replacing the current marketplace subscription with a new subscription changes the marketplace subscription for any existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems and all new systems.

== Troubleshoot the Marketplace subscription process

Sometimes subscribing to NetApp data services through the Google Cloud Marketplace can become fragmented due to incorrect permissions or accidentally not following the redirection to the Console. If this happens, use the following steps to complete the subscription process.

.Steps

. Navigate to the https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/netapp-cloudmanager/cloud-manager[NetApp page on the Google Cloud Marketplace^] to check on the state of the order. If the page states *Manage on Provider*, scroll down and select *Manage Orders*.

* If the order shows a green check mark and this is unexpected, somebody else from the organization using the same billing account might already be subscribed. If this is unexpected or you require the details of this subscription, contact your NetApp sales team.

* If the order shows a clock and *Pending* status, go back to the marketplace page and choose *Manage on Provider* to complete the process as documented above.
