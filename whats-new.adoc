=== Connector 3.9.44
This release includes support for Docker Engine 26, an enhancement to SSL certificates, and bug fixes.

The 3.9.44 release is available for standard mode and restricted mode.

.Support for Docker Engine 26 with new installations

Starting with the 3.9.44 release of the Connector, Docker Engine 26 is now supported with _new_ Connector installations on Ubuntu hosts.

If you have an existing Connector created prior to the 3.9.44 release, then Docker Engine 25.0.5 is still the maximum supported version on Ubuntu hosts.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-install-connector-on-prem.html#step-1-review-host-requirements[Learn more about Docker Engine requirements].

.Updated SSL certificate for local UI access

When you use BlueXP in restricted mode or private mode, the user interface is accessible from the Connector virtual machine that's deployed in your cloud region or on-premises. By default, BlueXP uses a self-signed SSL certificate to provide secure HTTPS access to the web-based console running on the Connector.

In this release, we made changes to the SSL certificate for new and existing Connectors:

* The Common Name for the certificate now matches the short host name

* The Certificate Subject Alternative Name is the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the host machine

=== Support for RHEL 9.4

BlueXP now supports installing the Connector on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 host when using BlueXP in standard mode or restricted mode. 

Support for RHEL 9.4 starts with the 3.9.40 release of the Connector.

The updated list of supported RHEL versions for standard mode and restricted mode now includes the following:

* 8.6 to 8.10
* 9.1 to 9.4

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-connector-operating-system-changes.html[Learn about support for RHEL 8 and 9 with the Connector].

=== Support for Podman 4.9.4 with all RHEL versions

Podman 4.9.4 is now supported with all supported versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Version 4.9.4 was previously supported with only RHEL 8.10.

The updated list of supported Podman versions includes 4.6.1 and 4.9.4 with Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts.

Podman is required for RHEL hosts starting with the 3.9.40 release of the Connector.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-connector-operating-system-changes.html[Learn about support for RHEL 8 and 9 with the Connector].

=== Updated AWS and Azure permissions

We updated the AWS and Azure policies for the Connector to remove permissions that are no longer required. The permissions were related to BlueXP edge caching and discovery and management of Kubernetes clusters, which are no longer supported as of August, 2024.

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions.html#change-log[Learn what changed in the AWS policy].
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions-azure.html#change-log[Learn what changed in the Azure policy].

== 22 August 2024

=== Connector 3.9.43 patch

We updated the Connector to support the Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.15.1 release. 

Support for this release includes an update to the Connector policy for Azure. The policy now includes the following permissions:

[source,json]
"Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/write",
"Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/read",
"Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/delete"

These permissions are required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP support of Virtual Machine Scale Sets. If you have existing Connectors and you want to use this new feature, you'll need to add these permissions to the custom roles that are associated with your Azure credentials.

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap-relnotes[Learn about the Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.15.1 release^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions-azure.html[View Azure permissions for the Connector].

== 8 August 2024

=== Connector 3.9.43

This release includes minor improvements and bug fixes.

The 3.9.43 release is available for standard mode and restricted mode.

=== Updated CPU and RAM requirements

To provide higher reliability and to improve the performance of BlueXP and the Connector, we now require additional CPU and RAM for the Connector virtual machine:

* CPU: 8 cores or 8 vCPUs (the previous requirement was 4)
* RAM: 32 GB (the previous requirement was 14 GB)

As a result of this change, the default VM instance type when deploying the Connector from BlueXP or from the cloud provider's marketplace is as follows:

* AWS: t3.2xlarge
* Azure: Standard_D8s_v3
* Google Cloud: n2-standard-8

The updated CPU and RAM requirements apply to all new Connectors. For existing Connectors, increasing the CPU and RAM is recommended to provide improved performance and reliability.

=== Support for Podman 4.9.4 with RHEL 8.10

Podman version 4.9.4 is now supported when installing the Connector on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.10 host.

=== User validation for identity federation

If you use identity federation with BlueXP, each user who logs in to BlueXP for the first time will need to complete a quick form to validate their identity.

== 31 July 2024

=== Private mode release (3.9.42)

A new private mode release is now available to download from the NetApp Support Site. 

.Support for RHEL 8 and 9

This release includes support for installing the Connector on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 or 9 host when using BlueXP in private mode. The following versions of RHEL are supported:

* 8.6 to 8.10
* 9.1 to 9.3

Podman is required as the container orchestration tool for these operating systems.

You should be aware of Podman requirements, known limitations, a summary of operating system support, what to do if you have a RHEL 7 host, how to get started, and more.
