== Configure multi-factor authentication

Configure multi-factor authentication (MFA) to improve security by requiring a second verification method.

Users who use single sign-on with an external identity provider or the NetApp Support Site cannot enable MFA. If either of these are true for you, you won't see the option to enable MFA in your profile settings.

Do not enable MFA if your user account is used for API access. Multi-factor authentication stops API access when enabled for a user account. Use service accounts for all API access.

.Before you begin
* You must have already downloaded an authentication app, such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, to your device.
* You'll need your password to set up MFA. 

NOTE: If you do not have access to your authentication app or lose your recovery code, contact your Console administrator for help.

.Steps
. Select the profile icon in the upper right corner of the Console to view the User settings panel.
. Select *Configure* next to the *Multi-Factor Authentication* header.
. Follow the prompts to set up MFA for your account. 
. When you finish, you'll be prompted to save your recovery code. Choose to either copy the code or download a text file containing the code. Keep this code somewhere safe. You need the recovery code if you lose access to your authentication app.

After you set up MFA, the Console prompts you to enter a one-time code from your authentication app each time you log in.

== Regenerate your MFA recovery code
You can only use recovery codes once. If you use or lose yours, create a new one.

.Steps
. Select the profile icon in the upper right corner of the the Console to view the User settings panel.
. Select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] next to the *Multi-Factor Authentication* header.
. Select *Regenerate recovery code*.
. Copy the generated recovery code and save it in a secure location.

== Delete your MFA configuration
To stop using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your login, delete your MFA configuration. This removes the need to enter a one-time code from your authentication app when you log in.

NOTE: If you are unable to access your authentication app or recovery code, you will need to contact your Organization administrator to reset your MFA configuration.

.Steps
. Select the profile icon in the upper right corner of the Console to view the User settings panel.
. Select image:icon-action.png["An icon that is three side-by-side dots"] next to the *Multi-Factor Authentication* header.
. Select *Delete*.




== Contact your Organization administrator
If you need to contact your organization administrator, you can send an email to them directly from the Console. The administrator manages user accounts and permissions within your organization.

NOTE: You must have a default email application configured for your browser to use the *Contact admins* feature. 

.Steps
. Select the profile icon in the upper right corner of the Console to view the User settings panel.
. Select *Contact admins* to send an email to your organization administrator. 
. Select the email application to use.
. Finish the email and select *Send*.

== Configure dark mode (dark theme)
You can set the Console to display in dark mode.

.Steps
. Select the profile icon in the upper right corner of the Console to view the User settings panel.
. Move the *Dark theme* slider to enable it.
