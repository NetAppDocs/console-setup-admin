//tag::dedicated[]
Dedicated host::
The Console agent is not supported on a host that is shared with other applications. The host must be a dedicated host. Host can be of any architecture that meets the following size requirements:

* CPU: 8 cores or 8 vCPUs
* RAM: 32 GB
* Disk space in /opt:: 100 GiB of space must be available
+
The agent uses `/opt` to install the `/opt/application/netapp` directory and its contents.

* Disk space in /var:: 20 GiB of space must be available
+
The Console agent requires this space in `/var` because Docker or Podman are architected to create the containers within this directory. Specifically, they will create containers in the `/var/lib/containers/storage` directory. External mounts or symlinks do not work for this space.
//end::dedicated[]

//tag::vmhost[]

* CPU: 8 cores or 8 vCPUs
* RAM: 32 GB
* Disk space: 165 GB (thick provisioned)
* vSphere 7.0 or higher
* ESXi host 7.03 or higher

//end::vmhost[]

//tag::manual-uid-range[]
NOTE: The Console agent reserves the UID and GID range of 19000 to 19200. This range is fixed and cannot be modified. If any third-party software on your host is using UIDs or GIDs within this range, the agent installation will fail. NetApp recommends using a host that is free of third-party software to avoid conflicts. 

//end::manual-uid-range[]

//tag::hypervisor[]
Hypervisor::
A bare metal or hosted hypervisor that is certified to run a supported operating system is required.
//end::hypervisor[]

//tag::os[]
[[podman-versions]]Operating system and container requirements::
The Console agent is supported with the following operating systems when using the Console in standard mode or restricted mode. A container orchestration tool is required before you install the agent.

Notes:

. Management of Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems is not supported by agents that have SELinux enabled on the operating system.
. The Console agent is supported on English-language versions of these operating systems.
. For RHEL, the host must be registered with Red Hat Subscription Management. If it's not registered, the host can't access repositories to update required 3rd-party software during agent installation.

PUT response hop limit when using IMDSv2::
If IMDSv2 is enabled on the EC2 instance (this is the default setting for new EC2 instances), you must change the PUT response hop limit on the instance to 3. If you don't change the limit on the EC2 instance, you'll receive a UI initialization error when you try to set up the agent.
