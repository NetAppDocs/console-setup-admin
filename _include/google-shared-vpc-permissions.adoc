If you are using a shared VPC to deploy resources into a service project, then you'll need to prepare your permissions. 

This table is for reference and your environment should reflect the permissions table when IAM configuration is complete.

Notes:

. deploymentmanager.editor is only required at the host project if you are not passing firewall rules to the deployment and are choosing to let the Console create them for you. The NetApp Console creates a deployment in the host project which contains the VPC0 firewall rule if no rule is specified.

. firewall.create and firewall.delete are only required if you are not passing firewall rules to the deployment and are choosing to let the Console create them for you. These permissions reside in the Console account .yaml file. If you are deploying an HA pair using a shared VPC, these permissions will be used to create the firewall rules for VPC1, 2 and 3. For all other deployments, these permissions will also be used to create rules for VPC0.

. For Cloud Tiering, the tiering service account must have the serviceAccount.user role on the service account, not just at the project level. Currently if you assign serviceAccount.user at the project level, the permissions don't show when you query the service account with getIAMPolicy.
