====

* For new agent deployments, NetApp checks for the following endpoints, link:reference-networking-saas-console.html[listed here^]. This configuration check fails with an error if you are using the previous endpoints used for upgrades,  link:reference-networking-saas-console-prev.html[listed here^]. NetApp recommends updating your firewall rules to allow access to the current endpoints and block access to the previous endpoints, link:reference-networking-saas-console.html[listed here^].


* If you update the endpoints in your firewall, your existing agents will continue to work.
