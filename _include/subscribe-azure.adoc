. Select *Administration > Credentials*.

. Select *Organization credentials*.

. Select the action menu for a set of credentials that are associated with a Console agent and then select *Configure Subscription*.
+
You must select credentials that are associated with a Console agent. You can't associate a marketplace subscription with credentials that are associated with the NetApp Console.

. To associate the credentials with an existing subscription, select the subscription from the down-down list and select *Configure*.

. To associate the credentials with a new subscription, select *Add Subscription > Continue* and follow the steps in the Azure Marketplace:

.. If prompted, log in to your Azure account.
.. Select *Subscribe*.
.. Fill out the form and select *Subscribe*.
.. After the subscription process is complete, select *Configure account now*.
+
You'll be redirected to the NetApp Console.
.. From the *Subscription Assignment* page:
+
* Select the Console organizations or accounts that you'd like to associate this subscription with.
* In the *Replace existing subscription* field, choose whether you'd like to automatically replace the existing subscription for one organization or account with this new subscription.
+
The Console replaces the existing subscription for all credentials in the organization or account with this new subscription. If a set of credentials wasn't ever associated with a subscription, then this new subscription won't be associated with those credentials.
+
For all other organizations or accounts, you'll need to manually associate the subscription by repeating these steps.

* Select *Save*.
