.. Create a YAML file that includes the permissions defined in the link:reference-permissions-gcp.html[Console agent policy for Google Cloud].

.. From Google Cloud, activate cloud shell.

.. Upload the YAML file that includes the required permissions for the Console agent.

.. Create a custom role by using the `gcloud iam roles create` command.
