. On the *Configure this software* page, ensure that you've selected the correct region and then select *Continue to Launch*.

. On the *Launch this software* page, under *Choose Action*, select *Launch through EC2* and then select *Launch*.
+
These steps describe how to launch the instance from the EC2 Console because the console enables you to attach an IAM role to the Console agent instance. This isn't possible using the *Launch from Website* action.

. Follow the prompts to configure and deploy the instance:

* *Name and tags*: Enter a name and tags for the instance.

* *Application and OS Images*: Skip this section. The Console agent AMI is already selected.

* *Instance type*: Depending on region availability, choose an instance type that meets RAM and CPU requirements (t3.2xlarge is preselected and recommended).

* *Key pair (login)*: Select the key pair that you want to use to securely connect to the instance.

* *Network settings*: Edit the network settings as needed:
+
** Choose the desired VPC and subnet.
** Specify whether the instance should have a public IP address.
** Specify security group settings that enable the required connection methods for the Console agent instance: SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
