* When you deploy a new agent, the validation check tests connectivity to current endpoints. If you use link:link:reference-networking-saas-console-previous.html[previous endpoints], the validation check fails. To avoid this failure, skip the validation check.
+

Although the previous endpoints are still supported, NetApp recommends updating your firewall rules to the current endpoints as soon as possible. link:reference-networking-saas-console-previous.html#update-endpoint-list[Learn how to update your endpoint list].



* When you update to the current endpoints in your firewall, your existing agents will continue to work.

//tag::upgrade-endpoints-explanation[]
//Same text is also in endpoints-manual-install
^1^ NetApp recommends allowing Option 1 endpoints in your firewall as they are more secure and disallowing Option 2 endpoints. Note the following about these endpoints:
+
* Starting with the 3.9.47 release of the Console agent, the system supports the endpoints listed in option 1. Previous releases of the Console agent do not support backwards compatibility.
* The Console agent first contacts the endpoints in option 2. If those endpoints are not accessible, it automatically contacts the endpoints in option 1.
* If you use the Console agent with NetApp Backup and Recovery or Ransomware Resilience, the system does not support Option 1 endpoints. Allow Option 2 endpoints and disallow Option 1.
