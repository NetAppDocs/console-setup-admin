.Before you begin

You should have the following:

* Root privileges to install the agent.

* Details about a proxy server, if a proxy is required for internet access from the agent.
+
You have the option to configure a proxy server after installation but doing so requires restarting the agent.

* A CA-signed certificate, if the proxy server uses HTTPS or if the proxy is an intercepting proxy.

.About this task

The installer that is available on the NetApp Support Site might be an earlier version. After installation, the agent automatically updates itself if a new version is available.

.Steps

. If the _http_proxy_ or _https_proxy_ system variables are set on the host, remove them:
+
[source,cli]
unset http_proxy
unset https_proxy
+
If you don't remove these system variables, the installation will fail.

. Download the agent software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-manager/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^], and then copy it to the Linux host.
+
You should download the "online" agent installer that's meant for use in your network or in the cloud.

. Assign permissions to run the script.
+
[source,cli]
chmod +x BlueXP-Connector-Cloud-<version>

+
Where <version> is the version of the agent that you downloaded.

. Run the installation script.
+
[source,cli]
 ./BlueXP-Connector-Cloud-<version> --proxy <HTTP or HTTPS proxy server> --cacert <path and file name of a CA-signed certificate>
+
The --proxy and --cacert parameters are optional. If you have a proxy server, you will need to enter the parameters as shown. The installer doesn't prompt you to provide information about a proxy.
+
Here's an example of the command using both optional parameters:
+
[source,cli]
 ./BlueXP-Connector-Cloud-v3.9.40--proxy https://user:password@10.0.0.30:8080/ --cacert /tmp/cacert/certificate.cer
+
--proxy configures the agent to use an HTTP or HTTPS proxy server using one of the following formats:
+
* \http://address:port
* \http://user-name:password@address:port
* \http://domain-name%92user-name:password@address:port
* \https://address:port
* \https://user-name:password@address:port
* \https://domain-name%92user-name:password@address:port
+
Note the following:
+
** The user can be a local user or domain user.
** For a domain user, you must use the ASCII code for a \ as shown above.
** The agent doesn't support user names or passwords that include the @ character.
** If the password includes any of the following special characters, you must escape that special character by prepending it with a backslash: & or !
+
For example:
+
\http://bxpproxyuser:netapp1\!@address:3128

+
--cacert specifies a CA-signed certificate to use for HTTPS access between the agent and the proxy server. This parameter is required only if you specify an HTTPS proxy server or if the proxy is an intercepting proxy.

. If you used Podman, you'll need to adjust the aardvark-dns port.
.. SSH to the agent virtual machine.
.. Open podman _/usr/share/containers/containers.conf_ file and modify the chosen port for Aardvark DNS service. For example, change it to 54.
+
[source, cli]
vi /usr/share/containers/containers.conf
...
# Port to use for dns forwarding daemon with netavark in rootful bridge
# mode and dns enabled.
# Using an alternate port might be useful if other DNS services should
# run on the machine.
#
dns_bind_port = 54
...
Esc:wq
+
.. Reboot the agent virtual machine.
//end::main-steps[]

//tag::standard-mode-steps-for-cloud[]
. Wait for the installation to complete.
+
At the end of the installation, the agent service (occm) restarts twice if you specified a proxy server.



. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the agent virtual machine and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_

. After you log in, set up the agent:
.. Specify the Console organization to associate with the agent.
.. Enter a name for the system.
.. Under *Are you running in a secured environment?* keep restricted mode disabled.
+
You should keep restricted mode disabled because these steps describe how to use the Console in standard mode. You should enable restricted mode only if you have a secure environment and want to disconnect this account from the Console backend services. If that's the case, link:task-quick-start-restricted-mode.html[follow steps to get started with the NetApp Console in restricted mode].
.. Select *Let's start*.
