Go to the Azure portal and assign the Azure custom role to the Console agent virtual machine for one or more subscriptions.

.Steps

. From the Azure Portal, open the *Subscriptions* service and select your subscription.
+
It's important to assign the role from the *Subscriptions* service because this specifies the scope of the role assignment at the subscription level. The _scope_ defines the set of resources that the access applies to. If you specify a scope at a different level (for example, at the virtual machine level), your ability to complete actions from within BlueXP will be affected.

. Select *Access control (IAM)* > *Add* > *Add role assignment*.

. In the *Role* tab, select the *BlueXP Operator* role and select *Next*.
