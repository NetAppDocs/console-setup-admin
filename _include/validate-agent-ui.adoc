If you selected the *Validate agent configuration* check box on the *Review* page, the Console verifies the configuration of the Console agent after it's created. If the Console fails to deploy the agent, it provides a downloadable report to help you troubleshoot.


NOTE: If the Console successfully deploys the agent, it does not generate a report and a confirmation dialog appears that verifies a successful deployment.


.Steps

. On the *Agent deployment failed* dialog box, select *Download report* to download a PDF file that contains the validation report.

. Alternatively, you can select *Start over* to return to the *Deploy agent* wizard and try again.
