You'll be redirected to the NetApp Console.

.. From the *Subscription Assignment* page:

* Select the Console organizations or accounts that you'd like to associate this subscription with.
* In the *Replace existing subscription* field, choose whether you'd like to automatically replace the existing subscription for one organization or account with this new subscription.
+
The Console replaces the existing subscription for all credentials in the organization or account with this new subscription. If a set of credentials wasn't ever associated with a subscription, then this new subscription won't be associated with those credentials.
+
For all other organizations or accounts, you'll need to manually associate the subscription by repeating these steps.
