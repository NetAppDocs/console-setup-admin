The NetApp Console provides centralized management of NetApp storage and NetApp Data Services across on-premises and cloud environments at enterprise gradeâ€”delivering real-time insights, faster workflows, and simplified administration, that is highly secure and compliant. 

It is available as a service (SaaS) platform that provides storage management, data mobility, data protection, and data analysis and control. Management capabilities are provided through a web-based console and APIs.

== Features

The Console unifies storage management and protection across hybrid multi-cloud with integrated data services to protect and optimize data.

=== Centralized storage management

Discover, deploy, and manage cloud and on-premises storage with the Console.

==== Supported cloud and on-premises storage

You can manage the following types of storage from the Console:

Cloud storage solutions::
* Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP
* Azure NetApp Files
* Cloud Volumes ONTAP
* Google Cloud NetApp Volumes

On-premises flash and object storage::
* E-Series systems
* ONTAP clusters
* StorageGRID systems

Cloud object storage::
* Amazon S3 storage
* Azure Blob storage
* Google Cloud Storage

==== Storage management 

Within the Console, _systems_ represent discovered or deployed storage. You can select a _system_ to integrate it with NetApp data services or manage storage, such as adding volumes.

== How NetApp Console works

The NetApp Console is web-based console that's provided through the SaaS layer, a resource and access management system, Console agents that manage storage systems and enable NetApp data services, and different deployment modes to meet your business requirements.

=== Software-as-a-service

You access the Console through a https://console.netapp.com[web-based interface^] and APIs. This SaaS experience enables you to automatically access the latest features as they're released.

=== Identity and access management (IAM)

The Console provides identity and access management (IAM) for resource and access management. This IAM model provides granular management of resources and permissions:

* A top-level _organization_ enables you to manage access across your various _projects_
* _Folders_ enable you to group related projects together
* Resource management enables you to associate a resource with one or more folders or projects
* Access management enables you to assign a role to members at different levels of the organization hierarchy

=== Console agents

A Console agent is needed for some additional features and data services. It enables you to manage resources and processes across your on-premises and cloud environments. You need it to manage some systems (for example, Cloud Volumes ONTAP) and to use some NetApp data services.

=== Deployment modes

Netapp offers two deployment modes for the NetApp Console: _Standard mode_ uses a software as a service (SaaS) layer for full functionality, while _restricted mode_ limits outbound connectivity.

NetApp continues to offer BlueXP for sites that need no outbound connectivity. BlueXP is available in private mode only. link:task-quick-start-private-mode.html[Learn about BlueXP (private mode) for sites with no internet connectivity.]

== SOC 2 Type 2 certification

An independent certified public accountant firm and services auditor examined the Console and affirmed that it achieved SOC 2 Type 2 reports based on the applicable Trust Services criteria.
