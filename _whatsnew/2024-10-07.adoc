=== BlueXP identity and access management

BlueXP identity and access management (IAM) is a new resource and access management model that replaces and enhances the previous functionality provided by BlueXP accounts when using BlueXP in standard mode. 

BlueXP IAM provides more granular management of resources and permissions:

* A top-level _organization_ enables you to manage access across your various _projects_.
* _Folders_ enable you to group related projects together.
* Enhanced resource management enables you to associate a resource with one or more folders or projects.
+
For example, you can associate a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system with multiple projects.
* Enhanced access management enables you to assign a role to members at different levels of the organization hierarchy.

These enhancements provide better control over the actions that users can perform and the resources that they can access.

.How BlueXP IAM affects your existing account

When you log in to BlueXP, you'll notice these changes:

* Your _account_ is now called an _organization_
* Your _workspaces_ are now called _projects_
* The names of user roles have changed:
** _Account admin_ is now _Organization admin_
** _Workspace admin_ is now _Folder or project admin_
** _Compliance viewer_ is now _Classification viewer_
* Under Settings, you can access BlueXP identity and access management to take advantage of these enhancements


Note the following:

* There are no changes to your existing users or working environments. 

* While the names of the roles have changed, there are no differences from a permissions perspective. Users will continue to have access to the same working environments as before.

* There are no changes to how you log in to BlueXP. BlueXP IAM works with NetApp cloud logins, NetApp Support Site credentials, and federated connections just like BlueXP accounts did.

* If you had multiple BlueXP accounts, you now have multiple BlueXP organizations.

.API for BlueXP IAM

This change introduces a new API for BlueXP IAM, but it is backwards compatible with the previous tenancy API. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-automation/tenancyv4/overview.html[Learn about the API for BlueXP IAM^]

.Supported deployment modes

BlueXP IAM is supported when using BlueXP in standard mode. If you're using BlueXP in restricted mode or private mode, then you'll continue using a BlueXP _account_ to manage workspaces, users, and resources.
