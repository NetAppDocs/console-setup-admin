BlueXP is now NetApp Console.

The NetApp Console, built on the enhanced and restructured BlueXP foundation, provides centralized management of NetApp storage and NetApp Data Services across on-premises and cloud environments at enterprise gradeâ€”delivering real-time insights, faster workflows, and simplified administration, that is highly secure and compliant.

=== More intuitive naming of elements, data services, and features

NetApp has renamed several elements, data services, and features to better reflect their purpose. Here are some of the key changes:

* *Connectors* have been renamed *Console agents* to better reflect their role in both manageability and connectivity to data services. View, add, and manage your agents from the *Administration > Agents* menu.

* NetApp has renamed the *Timeline* to *Audit* to reflect its purpose of tracking user and system activities. View audit Console activity from the *Administration > Audit* menu.

* *Working environments* have been renamed to *Systems*. View, add, and manage your systems from the *Storage > Management* menu. 

* *BlueXP Ransomware protection* has been renamed to *NetApp Ransomware Resilience*. Ransomware Resilience helps you protect your data and recover quickly from a ransomware attack.

* *BlueXP economic efficiency* has been renamed *Lifecycle planning*. Lifecycle planning helps you optimize your storage costs by identifying unused and underutilized resources.

* *BlueXP digital wallet* has been renamed to *Licenses and subscriptions* to reflect its purpose of managing your NetApp licenses and subscriptions.

==== Select and manage Console agents

Access and manage your Console agents from the *Administration > Agents* menu. They way t-select a Console agent for the Systems page (formerly the Canvas) has also changed. An icon (image:icon-agent.png) has replaced the Connector menu name, allowing you to select the Console agent that you want to view systems for.
