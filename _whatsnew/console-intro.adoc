BlueXP is now NetApp Console.

The NetApp Console, built on the enhanced and restructured BlueXP foundation, provides centralized management of NetApp storage and NetApp Data Services across on-premises and cloud environments at enterprise gradeâ€”delivering real-time insights, faster workflows, and simplified administration, that is highly secure and compliant.

The following lists the navigational and terminology changes in the NetApp Console. For a complete list of features in this 6 October 2025 release, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/whats-new.html#10-06-2025[What's new in NetApp Console].


=== Navigation menus

NetApp moved most menu options to the left-navigation pane and reorganized menus for easier navigation in the NetApp Console.

==== Canvas is replaced by the Systems page

NetApp renamed the Canvas to the *Systems* page. Navigate to the *System* page from the *Storage > Management* menu.

The *Storage* menu also includes *Alerts* to view ONTAP system alerts and *Lifecycle planning* (formerly *Economic efficiency*) to identify unused or underutilized resources.

NetApp has also moved Keystone to the *Storage* menu, where you can manage your NetApp Keystone subscriptions and view your usage.

A reimagined *Health* menu includes *Software updates* where you can manage ONTAP software updates, *Sustainability* where you can monitor your environmental impact, and *Digital Advisor* where you can get proactive recommendations to optimize your storage environment.

==== Governance menu

The *Governance* menu includes *Data Classification* where you can manage data classification and compliance and the *Automation hub* where you can create and manage automation workflows.



=== More intuitive naming of elements, data services, and features

NetApp renamed several elements, data services, and features to clarify their purpose. Key changes include:

* *Connectors* have been renamed *Console agents* to better reflect their role in both manageability and connectivity to data services. View, add, and manage your agents from the *Administration > Agents* menu.

* NetApp has renamed the *Timeline* to *Audit* to reflect its purpose of tracking user and system activities. View audit Console activity from the *Administration > Audit* menu.

* *Working environments* have been renamed to *Systems*. View, add, and manage your systems from the *Storage > Management* menu. 

* *BlueXP Ransomware protection* has been renamed to *NetApp Ransomware Resilience*. Ransomware Resilience helps you protect your data and recover quickly from a ransomware attack.

* **BlueXP Economic Efficiency* has been renamed *Lifecycle Planning*. Lifecycle Planning helps you optimize your storage costs by identifying unused and underutilized resources.

* *BlueXP digital wallet* has been renamed to *Licenses and subscriptions* to reflect its purpose of managing your NetApp licenses and subscriptions.

==== Select and manage Console agents

Access and manage your Console agents from the *Administration > Agents* menu. NetApp has changed how to select a Console agent for the *Systems* page (formerly the Canvas). NetApp has replaced the Connector menu name with an icon image:icon-agent.png["agent icon"], allowing you to select the Console agent that you want to view systems for.

You can also manage your agents from the *Administration > Agents* menu.
