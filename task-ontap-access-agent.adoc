By default, the Console agent credentials allow users to access the Advanced View (ONTAP System Manager). You can prompt users for their ONTAP credentials instead. This ensures that a user's ONTAP permissions are applied when they work with ONTAP clusters in both Cloud Volumes ONTAP and ONTAP on-premises clusters.

NOTE: You must have the Organization admin role to edit Console agent settings.

.Steps

. Select *Administration > Agents*.

. On the *Overview* page, select the action menu for a Console agent and select *Edit agent*.
+
The Console agent must be active to edit it.

. Expand the *Force Credentials* option.

. Select the checkbox to enable the *Force Credentials* option and then select *Save*.

. Verify that the *Force Credentials* option is enabled.
