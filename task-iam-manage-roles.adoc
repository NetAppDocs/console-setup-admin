Within the Console, you can assign roles to users based on what they need to do and where. 

Users with the *Organization admin* or *Folder or project admin* role have the responsibility of assigning roles to other users. You can assign access roles on a project or folder basis. For example, you can assign a user the Ransomware Resilience admin role for one project and the SnapCenter admin role for a different project. Alternatively, if a user needs the Classification admin role for all projects within a specific folder, you can give them this role at the folder level.

Use access roles to assign access to storage resources based on the specific tasks that users need to perform. For example, if a user needs to interact with Ransomware Resilience, they must be given an access role that includes either viewing or administrative permissions for Ransomware Resilience for the project for which the access role is granted.

Assign roles to users based on your IAM strategy for enhanced security. IAM roles ensure users have only the access they need.

NOTE: Remember that you can't directly grant access to resources. Assign resources to projects first. Consider setting up your resource hierarchy before assigning users access. link:task-iam-manage-folders-projects.html[Learn how to organize your resources with folders and projects.]

== View roles(s) assigned to a member

When you add a member to your organization, you are prompted to assign them a role. You can members to verify which roles they are currently assigned.

If you have the _Folder or project admin_ role, the page displays all members in the organization. However, you can only view and manage member permissions for the folders and projects for which you have permissions. link:reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn more about the actions that a _Folder or project admin_ can complete].

== Add an access role to a member

You typically assign a role when adding a member to your organization, but you can update it at any time by removing or adding roles.

You can assign a user an access role for your organization, folder, or project. 

Members can have multiple roles within the same project and in different projects. For example, smaller organizations may assign all available access roles to the same user, while larger organizations may have users do more specialized tasks. Alternatively, you could also assign one user the Ransomware Resilience admin role for an organization. In that example, the user would be able to perform Ransomware Resilience tasks on all projects within your organization. 

Your access role strategy should align with the way you have organized your NetApp resources. 

TIP: A member who is assigned the Organization admin role can't be assigned any additional roles. They already have permissions across the entire organization. A member with the Folder or project role can't be assigned any other roles within the folder or project where they have that role already. Both of these roles provide access to all services within the scope that they are assigned.

== Change a member's assigned role

You can change the assigned roles for a member should you need to adjust the access for a user.

NOTE: Users must have at least one role assigned to them. You can't remove all roles from a user. If you need to remove all roles, you must delete the user from your organization.

.Steps

. Select *Administration > Identity and access*.
