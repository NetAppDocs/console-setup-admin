[.lead]
Within the NetApp Console, you organize your NetApp resources using projects and folders. A _project_ represents a workspace in the Console that organization members access to manage _resources_ (for example, a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system). A _folder_ groups related projects together. After you organize your resources into folders and projects, you can grant granular access to resources by providing organization members with permissions to specific folders and projects.

== Add a folder or project

When you create your organization, it includes a single project. Add projects to manage resources and folders to group related projects.

Your organization's resource hierarchy can have up to seven levels, with folders nested six levels deep and projects at the seventh.
